During this exercise, my 2 partners and I worked on creating a snowfall effect. We then broke apart to try to add in our own “flare”. In class we realized Conor had the most experience whereas me and Nongmo did not have much experience. We slowly learned how to code and about for loops and if else statements during the exercise.

For my snowfall effect, I wanted to add a puppy to the canvas. I used img to add a picture of a cartoon corgi which can be controlled by the cursor. To view the corgi, the file needs to be served from a local server.

In the next assignment I would like to create an interaction between the dog and the snow. Perhaps the dog can move around and eat all the snow.
